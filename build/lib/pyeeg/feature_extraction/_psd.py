    """The power of each frequency band is calculated according to the frequency band division，and then it combines the frequency band power into a feature vector. It mainly uses Welch method.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array
        data, for DEAP dataset, It's shape may be (n_trials,n_slices, n_channels, points) （40, 63, 32, 128）
    sf : int, optional
        sampling frequency, by default 128
    nperseg : int, optional
        for Welch method, According to scipy.signal.welch , by default 1
    band : tuple, optional
        boundary frequencies of bands, by default (4, 8, 14, 31, 65)
        e.g. for (4, 8, 14, 31, 65), It will calculate the power spectrum of theta(4~7Hz),alpha(8~13Hz),beta(14~30Hz) and gamma(31~64Hz).

    Returns
    -------
    f:
        Solved feature, It's shape is similar to the shape of your input data.
        e.g. for input.shape is (n_trials,n_slices n_channels, points), the f.shape is (n_trials,n_slices, n_channels, n_features)
    
    Example
    ------

    In [6]: d.shape, l.shape
    Out[6]: ((40, 32, 8064), (40, 1))

    In [7]: psd(d).shape
    Out[7]: (40, 32, 5) # Each channel has 5 bands of average power
    
    In [12]: d, l = split_signal(d, l)

    In [13]: d.shape, l.shape
    Out[13]: ((40, 63, 32, 128), (40, 63))
